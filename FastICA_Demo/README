To use this code, run ECSE444_Demo in matlab.

The files have been stripped away of unnecessary code. If you want to see 
the original source code (as linked in the ICA slides provided in the
lab handout), go through the original_ICA_code folder.

This is the deflationary approach, estimating a single vector 'w' of the 
unmixing matrix 'W' at a time. The non-linearity function used here is 
'pow3'. You may use tanh if desired, and you can refer to the original code
for how to use it.
